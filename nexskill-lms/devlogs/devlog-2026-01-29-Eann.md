## Branch: feat/course-detail-tabs-real-data

### Overview

Implemented the full tabbed interface for the Student Course Detail page (`CourseDetailRefactored.tsx`), integrating real data from Supabase for Curriculum, Reviews, and Coach details.

### Key Changes Made

#### 1. New UI Components
-   **`CourseCurriculumTab.tsx`**: Displays the course curriculum with expandable modules and lessons/quizzes.
-   **`CourseReviewsTab.tsx`**: Shows a list of student reviews with ratings and comments.
-   **`CourseCoachTab.tsx`**: detailed instructor profile card with bio and stats.

#### 2. Data Logic (`useCourse.ts`)
-   Updated the `fetchCourse` function to retrieve comprehensive data:
    -   **Curriculum**: Fetches `modules`, `module_content_items`, `lessons`, and `quizzes` and structures them hierarchically.
    -   **Coach**: Fetches linked `profile` and `coach_profile` data.
    -   **Reviews**: Fetches reviews joined with user profiles.
-   Fixed type definitions for `Lesson`, `CourseDisplay`, and filtering logic.
-   Simplified the query structure to avoid Foreign Key constraint errors (removed explicit `!courses_coach_id_fkey` hint).
-   Added robust error handling to expose specific Supabase error messages in the UI.

#### 3. Page Integration
-   Updated `CourseDetailRefactored.tsx` to include state management for tabs.
-   Added tab navigation bar (Overview, Curriculum, Reviews, Coach).
-   Integrated the new tab components.
-   Added error boundary-like error message display for better debugging.

### Technical Details
-   **Data Fetching Strategy**: Instead of a single massive join which was causing errors, I split the fetching into:
    1.  Main Course retrieval.
    2.  Parallel fetches for related data (Coach, Category, Curriculum items) using the IDs returned from the main course.
    3.  This approach is more robust against null relations and schema constraints.

### Next Steps
-   Verify responsive design of the new tabs on mobile.
-   Add pagination to Reviews if the list grows large.
-   Implement actual "Add Review" functionality.
-   Add "Ask a Question" feature in the Coach tab.
